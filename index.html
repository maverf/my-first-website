    <h1>genre란 무엇인가?</h1>
    <p>Genre (UK: /ˈʒɑ̃ː.rə/, /ˈʒɒn.rə/; US: /ˈʒɑːn.rə/)[1] (from French genre 'kind, or sort')[2] is any form or type
        of communication in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed-upon conventions
        developed over time.[3] In popular usage, it normally describes a category of literature, music, or other forms
        of art or entertainment, based on some set of stylistic criteria[4] Often, works fit into multiple genres by way
        of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have
        individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions.
        Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.</p>
